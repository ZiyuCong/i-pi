The
manual included in the development version should document all the new
keyword. You can create a pdf version of the manual using the make
utility (see
[here](https://github.com/cosmo-epfl/i-pi-dev/blob/master/doc/README)). The
manual for the last official release is also available as pdf
[here]({{ site.url }}/assets/pdf/manual.pdf).
