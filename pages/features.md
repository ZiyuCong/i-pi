i-PI includes a large number of sophisticated methods, that
have been contributed over the years by many people. Here you
will find a comprehensive list, that we try to keep updated. 
Please get in touch if we are missing something or someone, and 
please format your contribution section following this 
[MAKE A LINK!]template. 

Developers receive too little recognition for their implementation
efforts. For this reason, we list together with every feature
not only the paper(s) that first introduced the methods, but also
those that were connected with the implementation of the method in i-PI.
Finding these features readily available is saving you weeks of work:
reward the developers by spending 15 seconds to add one more citation
to your manuscript!



TODO: work out how to have copiable bibtex
